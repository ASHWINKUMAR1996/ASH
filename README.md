# TITANIC DATASET

This is my take on the renowned Titanic Dataset. Since, the problem is very common among the Data Science Fraternity, I worked on it without reading articles about how to get the maximum accuracy. Instead, I chose to flex my knowledge on the dataset and went about it. The path I chose is very subjective and I have justified every step of the way as to why I did it.

To my surprise, I ranked #631 when I uploaded my predictions to the Kaggle Website.

Top 5% on my first few attempts.

I am pursuing other methods to increase this accuracy.
